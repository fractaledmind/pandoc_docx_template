>For it shall be my dirge and chant me down 
>Over the mournful flood to the dim shore, 
>Where I shall find Quintilius and our tears.
>Yes, farewell, Horace! Unto you I leave 
>The laurel and the letters that we loved; 
>Till we shall meet again. I cannot hold 
>Your light yet heavy Epicurean creed; 
>Your lays *"shall outlive brass and pyramid"*, 
>But he that made them shall outlive the lays, 
>Though how or where we know not.

## Introduction

The death of Vergil was no doubt a tragic event for Rome and her
citizens, and even more so for his friends, among whom would surely be
the poet Horace.[^1] Unfortunately, we have little extant which might shed
light on their friendship more generally and Horace’s reaction to
Vergil’s death in particular;[^2] little, that is, save *Odes* 4.12. An odd
poem, it invites Vergil to join Horace at a symposium, although the poem
was published six years after Vergil's death in 19 BC.[^3] This post-mortem
poem to Vergil forms an odd pair with an earlier ode also addressed to
Vergil and also written following the death of a friend—*Odes* 1.24. In
this poem Vergil receives frank criticism for his excessive and
misguided mourning after the death of their mutual friend Quintilius
Varus.[^4] While in 1.24 Horace consoles the aggrieved Vergil, in 4.12
Horace finds himself in Vergil's position—grieving the death of a
friend. 

[^1]: On their friendship, see Campbell 1987: 314-318 and Duckworth 1956:
281-316; that the two were not friends by the time of the *Odes*, see
Thomas 2001: 60 who argues that Horace and Vergil were only
acquaintances and Moritz 1969: 13 who believes that the friendship was
strained by the publication of the *Odes*. For a response to such
readings, see Margheim 2012.

[^2]: Horace’s poetry provides the sole basis for positing a friendship.
Vergil never mentions Horace by name in his poetry, and no other
contemporary or near-contemporary sources ascribe *amicitia* to the two
poets, although by 380 St. Jerome assumes a friendship. Horace names
Vergil ten times throughout his corpus (*Sat*. 1.5.40, 48, 1.6.55,
1.10.45, 81; *Odes* 1.3.6, 1.24.10, 4.12.13; *Ep*. 2.1.247; *A.P*. 55),
five times in the *Satires* alone, where Vergil consistently appears as
a friend and colleague. 

[^3]: Though there is some debate whether the Vergilius of 4.12 is Virgil the
poet, the *opinio communis* today asserts this identification (see
below, p. --).

[^4]: For readings of *Odes* 1.24, see Commager 1995: 287-90, Khan 1999,
Nisbet and Hubbard 1970: 279-89, Lowrie 1994: 377-394, Putnam 1993, and
West 1995: 112-15. For the Epicurean, and specifically Philodeman,
influence on the ode, see Thibodeau 2003: 243-56 and Armstrong 2008:
97-99.


Horace confronts grief and death directly in both *Odes* 1.24 and 4.12,
and each poem ends with a generalizing *sententia*, yet their import would
appear contradictory. On the one hand, *Odes* 1.24 recommends the
consolatory power of patience:

>Durum; sed levius fit patientia

>     quicquid corrigere est nefas  
>-- *Odes* 1.24.19-20
\
\
>It is hard; but whatever is forbidden to correct becomes easier to bear
with patience.,[^5]

[^5]: Unless noted, Latin text of Horace's *Odes* is Garrison 1991 and
translations are my own.

On the other hand, *Odes* 4.12 turns to the sweetness of folly:

>misce stultitiam consiliis brevem: 

>     dulce est desipere in loco.  
>-- *Odes* 4.12.25-28
\
\
>Mix brief folly into your plans: it is sweet to act the fool in the
proper place.

This seeming contradiction forces the question: How ought one to
understand *Odes* 4.12 in relation to 1.24? More specifically, this paper
considers whether Horace has contradicted his own advice in 1.24 by
addressing Vergil as if alive in 4.12. Taken together, these two
post-mortem poems addressed to Vergil form a diptych of sorts, offering
insight into how Horace believes one ought to or can mourn. In *Odes* 1.24
Horace, in the persona of a philosophical teacher, advises that one
*ought* to mourn moderately and patiently; in 4.12, however, Horace the
convivial poet suggests that the foolishness of mourning has its proper
place. I argue that this is not an about-face in Horace’s philosophy,
but rather a shift in emphasis. 

This paper begins with brief but thorough readings of the two odes,
paying particular attention to their consolatory elements. I demonstrate
that *Odes* 1.24 offers a consolation built upon Epicurean philosophy and
emotional therapy, while *Odes* 4.12 draws heavily from the Epicurean
practice of commemoration. This leads me to my final argument, that the
symposium of 4.12 represents a poetic memorial of Horace and Vergil's
friendship. In the end I argue that Horace, in an attempt to console
himself, imagines and invokes Vergil’s literary persona to share in a
poetic dialogue, thereby creating a poetic space in which the
acknowledged folly of such a post-mortem invocation is permitted.
